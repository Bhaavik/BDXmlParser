# BDXmlParser
XmlParser For Swift

Anyone who want Normal Dictionary From Their XML data Response Can use below Function.
Pass Data coming from Api response and have Dictionary in return of it.

I have used Class Created below To get Dictionary From XML data.


  let objXmlParser = BbXmlParser()
  
  let  dictResponse  =  objXmlParser.getdictionaryFromXmlData(data!)
  
  print(dictResponse)
  
And here You go with dictionary. :)
